# SCSS and Sass syntax for Sublime Text 3

Includes completions for CSS properties and values, as well as relevant Sass functions.

Highlights code using up to date specifications for properties and values to help you catch typos.

Syntax highlighting should be very similar to [CSS](https://github.com/sublimehq/Packages/tree/master/CSS) and [LESS](https://github.com/danro/LESS-sublime) (which is maintained in parallel).


## Installation

This package is available through [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io).


## 2.0

Version 2.0 introduces new highlighting and completion features. This is a pretty big change, so for those who want it the previous version is still available as well as a different package: [Syntax Highlighting for Sass](https://github.com/P233/Syntax-highlighting-for-Sass).
