### SublimeText 3 Syntax Files (Expected: 2.1.0)

There are numerous issues related to syntax highlighting. Syntax highlighting in SublimeText 2 was driven by collections of regular expressions. SublimeText 3 syntax highlighting still uses regexps and offers the ability to be more stateful. However, transitioning from _SublimeHaskell_'s improved ST2 syntax highlighting to ST3 syntax highlighting requires substantial work.

### The SublimeHaskell Editing Guide (Ongoing)

Documentation is always a good thing. The guide is a work-in-progress.
